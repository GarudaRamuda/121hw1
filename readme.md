Please make sure to navigate to Assets/Scenes and open SampleScene.

My scene is a simple bedroom and computer setup.
I included various objects inspired by my own personal computer setup, focusing on objects that express my interest in certain games and art.
The main character is the object titled voltaire, a character I designed and modeled previously.
